**Genesis Note**

This project does not exist to rule, persist, or win.

It exists to make agreement easier when coercion is neither possible nor desired.

There is no final authority here.
Not the code.
Not the foundation.
Not the founders.
Not future stewards.

Legitimacy arises only through use.
If people follow, it matters.
If they don’t, it doesn’t.

Governance is how we agree enough to act.
Disagreement is expected.
Forking is legitimate.
Exit requires no permission.

Execution must remain neutral.
When execution is used for campaigning or self-preservation, trust is broken.
The correct response is not protest, reform, or capture.
The correct response is to branch.

Stewardship is provisional.
It exists to serve, not to decide.
If stewardship is captured, it should be ignored.
If it is ignored, the system is working.

The code is free.
Anyone may use it, change it, or abandon it.
No use implies endorsement.
No fork implies betrayal.

This system may evolve.
It may fragment.
It may disappear.

If it fades quietly because it is no longer useful, that is an acceptable outcome.

A system that must be obeyed has already failed.
A system that can be left is finally honest.

## Usage (Proof of Concept)

What follows is a minimal proof of concept. It is illustrative, not normative.

This repository includes a small browser-based example using a SOLID Pod.

To run it locally:

```bash
npm create vite@latest solid-poc -- --template react-ts
cd solid-poc
npm install
npm install @inrupt/solid-client @inrupt/solid-client-authn-browser
npm run dev

You will need a SOLID Pod and identity provider to use the PoC.

This client is one possible implementation concept. Others are expected.
